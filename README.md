# CRUX 

Get ready to climb to new heights with Crux! Our app will help you track your progress, discover new routes, and connect with fellow climbers.


## Usage

With Crux, users can track routes they've climbed, view all available routes, and add new routes to the list. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced climber, Crux is here to help you send.

Track the routes you've climbed and keep a record of your progress. Want to try a new route? Browse our list of routes to find one that suits your skill level and preferences. Our routes are categorized by difficulty, location, and type of climb, so you can easily find what you're looking for.

But that's not all! You can also leave reviews for each route, letting others know about the rock quality, safety, and overall quality of the climb. Share your tips and tricks with the climbing community and help others dial in their beta.

And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even submit new routes to the list. Share the stoke AND your favorite climbs with other Crux users by adding to our ever-growing list of routes.

Whether you're hitting up your local gym or venturing out to some new crags, CRUX will help you keep track of all your climbing goals and achievements.

So what are you waiting for? Grab your gear, chalk up your hands, and let Crux guide you to new heights. With Crux in your corner, you'll be crushing it in no time!
